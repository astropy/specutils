Spectral World Coordinate Systems
=================================

.. currentmodule:: specutils.wcs.specwcs

In its simplest representation a spectrum is a one-dimensional array storing the flux information. In this form pixel indices
form a coordinate system for the spectrum. In most cases, however, the data has been calibrated in a way that
allows a mapping between pixel coordinates and physical coordinates. These transformations are often referred to
as a world coordinate system (WCS) and can be thought of as functions:

.. math::
    f_{\textrm{WCS}}(c_0, c_1, \dots, c_l;\ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \mapsto y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m,

where :math:`c_i` represents a parameter for the transform, :math:`x_j` are pixel coordinates and :math:`y_k` are spectral coordinates (e.g. angstrom).

:class:`~astropy.modeling.core.Model` is essentially a parametrized function and thus is an ideal way to represent WCS transformations.
In addition, there are fitters available (link) that can be used to create WCS transforms from calibration data.
Here's how a simple model (:math:`f(c_0, c_1;\ x_0) = c_0 \exp{(c_1 x_0)}`) would look in python::

    class SimpleModel(astropy.modeling.Model):

        c_0 = astropy.modeling.Parameter('c_0')
        c_1 = astropy.modeling.Parameter('c_1')

        def __init__(self, c_0, c_1):
            super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
            self.c_0 = c_0
            self.c_1 = c_1

        def __call__(self, x_0):
            y_0 = self.c_0 * np.exp(self.c_1 * x_0)
            return y_0

It would be used in the following way::

    >>> mymodel = SimpleModel(5, 6)
    >>> mymodel(7)
    8.6963747076025047e+18



Spectral 1D WCS
---------------

The simplest WCS for 1D is a lookup table. This is often found in a ascii tables where one column
is the lookup table (wavelength array) and one column is the flux array. In terms of the functional transform view:
the lookup table represents a parameter (:math:`c_0`)::

    >>> from specutils import Spectrum1D
    >>> from specutils.wcs import specwcs
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> wave = np.arange(6000, 9000) # wavelength
    >>> flux = np.random.random(3000) # flux
    >>> lookup_table_wcs = specwcs.Spectrum1DLookupWCS(wave, unit='angstrom') # Creating the wcs
    >>> lookup_table_wcs(0) # doing the transformation for pixel 0
    <Quantity 6000.0 Angstrom>
    >>> Spectrum1D(flux=flux, wcs=lookup_table_wcs)
    Spectrum1D([ 0.66118716,  0.39584688,  0.81210479, ...,  0.5238203 ,
             0.05986459,  0.11621466])

For more information about the Spectrum1d object go to :doc:`spectrum1d`.

Another common WCS is the linear dispersion (:math:`f_{\textrm{WCS}}(x) = c_0 + c_1 x`) and commonly serialized (encoded) to FITS keyword headers.
For linear dispersion we are using the general `Spectrum1DPolynomialWCS` WCS::

    >>> from specutils.wcs import specwcs
    >>> linear_wcs = specwcs.Spectrum1DPolynomialWCS(degree=1, c0=6000, c1=1., unit='angstrom')
    >>> linear_wcs(1.5)
    <Quantity 6001.5 Angstrom>


For more information about reading and writing WCS transformations to the FITS File format see `FITS and WCS <fitswcs>`.

In addition, the following WCS models exist as well:

.. Interpolation
    -------------
    In the following, we explain interpolation in one-dimension, however the concepts remain the same in n-dimensional space.
    Interpolation means going from the current WCS transform axis(:math:`f_\textrm{WCS}`) to another WCS transform axis (:math:`g_textrm{WCS}`).
    In the first instance, one needs to know what pixel in the new WCS transform axis represents what pixel (and that might often be a fractional one) in the old one:
    For example a simple shift by half a pixel:
    .. math::
        \textrm{pixel}_\textrm{new} 0 \mapsto \textrm{pixel}_\textrm{old} 0.5; \dots
        \textrm{pixel}_\textrm{new} 1 \mapsto \textrm{pixel}_\textrm{old} 1.5\\
        \Rightarrow h(\textrm{pixel}_\textrm{new}) \mapsto \textrm{pixel}_\textrm{old}
    Knowing both transformations (:math:`f_\textrm{WCS}` and :math:`g_\textrm{WCS}`), one can create the function
    :math:`h = g(f^{-1})` and transform represent the new pixel coordinates in the old system and interpolate.
    .. warning::
        This does not currently work and is being developed
    This example showcases the API. Currently the interpolate method accepts a WCS object or an `~numpy.ndarray`
    (then constructs a `~specutils.wcs.specwcs.Spectrum1DLookupWCS` out of it)::
        >>> from specutils import Spectrum1D
        >>> from specutils.wcs import specwcs
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> wave = np.arange(6000, 9000) # wavelength
        >>> flux = np.random.random(3000) # flux
        >>> myspec = Spectrum1D.from_array(wave, flux, dispersion_unit='angstrom')
        >>> myspec.interpolate(wave + 0.5)
