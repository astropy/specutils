Spectrum Utilities
==================

The ``specutils``-package is intended to implement utilities and data structures to handle astronomical spectra.
The initial goal is to focus on electromagnetic spectra, but the end goal is to support spectra of any kind.

Currently we have implemented:

 * A simple Spectrum1D object that is currently in the very early stages
 * A method to calculate extinction
