Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.18.0 (2024-10-16)
-------------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New ``Spectrum1D.with_spectral_axis_and_flux_units`` method to convert both
  spectral axis and flux units at the same time. [#1184]

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed ``Spectrum1D.with_flux_unit()`` not converting uncertainty along
  with flux unit. [#1181]

- Fixed ``mwmVisit`` SDSS-V ``Spectrum1D`` and ``SpectrumList`` default loader 
  being unable to load files containing only BOSS instrument spectra. [#1185]

- Fixed automatic format detection for SDSS-V ``SpectrumList`` default loaders. [#1185]

- Fixed extracting a spectral region when one of spectrum/region is in wavelength
  and the other is in frequency units. [#1187]


Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  recommended by ``astropy``. [#1180]

  now defaults to ``Morton2000`` as the method instead of ``Griesen2006``. [#1169]

1.16.0 (2024-08-08)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

  header into ``meta['header']``; the old behaviour of reading the
  header from the data extension can be restored by setting the option
  ``store_data_header=True``. The writer is taking a corresponding option
  for saving ``meta['header']`` to either primary or data extension headers. [#1113]

  ``uncertainty`` array. [#1118]

- ``with_spectral_unit`` has been changed to ``with_spectral_axis_unit`` and actually works
  now. [#1119]

- Template correlation functions now truncate to overlapping region to avoid NaNs in normalization
  when spectrum and template have non-overlapping regions. [#1121]

- Fixed numpy error when printing a ``Spectrum1D`` object. [#1123]

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Made a couple small updates to developer docs. [#1110, #1112]

  to use an ``astropy.uncertainty`` distribution instead of the analytic solution. [#1057]

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Drastically improved performance of region extraction. [#1048]

  As a result, minversion of ``asdf`` has been bumped to 2.14.
  Redundant ASDF schema for ``SpectralCoord`` is removed.
  It also now supports ``mask`` serialization. [#1042, #1053]

- JWST X1D reader will no longer raise a ``UnitWarning`` for surface brightness
  error. [#1050]
