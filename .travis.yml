install:

  # We now use the ci-helpers package to set up our testing environment.
  # This is done by using Miniconda and then using conda and pip to install
  # dependencies. Which dependencies are installed using conda and pip is
  # determined by the CONDA_DEPENDENCIES and PIP_DEPENDENCIES variables,
  # which should be space-delimited lists of package names. See the README
  # in https://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers for information about the full
  # list of environment variables that can be used to customize your
  # environment. In some cases, ci-helpers may not offer enough flexibility
  # in how to install a package, in which case you can have additional
  # commands in the install: section below.

  - git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers.git
  - source ci-helpers/travis/setup_conda.sh

  # As described above, using ci-helpers, you should be able to set up an
  # environment with dependencies installed using conda and pip, but in some
  # cases this may not provide enough flexibility in how to install a
  # specific dependency (and it will not be able to install non-Python
  # dependencies). Therefore, you can also include commands below (as
  # well as at the start of the install section or in the before_install
  # section if they are needed before setting up conda) to install any
  # other dependencies.

script:
  - $MAIN_CMD $SETUP_CMD

after_success:
# If coveralls.io is set up for this package, uncomment the line below.
# The coveragerc file may be customized as needed for your package.
# - if [[ $SETUP_CMD == *coverage* ]]; then coveralls --rcfile='specutils/tests/coveragerc'; fi
